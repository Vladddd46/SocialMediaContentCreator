Managable accounts are configured in file './configurations/managable_accounts.json'.
You may find ./configurations/example_managable_accounts.json and you have to rename it into managable_accounts.json.


This is .json file, which consists of list of account configurations.
Each account configuration has the following structure:

}

    every_days - per how much days content will be posts. 1 means every day
    at_time - at what time content will be posted. Must be a list of time in format hh:mm



Note: Tiktok does not support automatic login, so to make script work you should place cookies.txt file into accounts_data/TIKTOK/account_name/creds folder. accounts_data folder is automatically created after first run of the script. So, run 'python main.py' and after default folder structure will be created, add cookies.txt into accounts_data/TIKTOK/account_name/creds.

File cookies.txt can be retrieved via chrome extension "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY". Just login into your tiktok account and use this extension to retrieve cookies.
